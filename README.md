# Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi
### Coming Soon. Work under Progress.
An Implementation of Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi. With this Open-Source BoilerPlate Template, you will get access to the world of Loosely-Coupled and Inverted-Dependency Architecture in ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi with a lot of best practices.

## Purpose of this Project
The primary goal is to create a Full-Fledged implementation, that is well documented along with the steps taken to build this Solution from Scratch. I also intend to make this Solution available as a Solution Template within Visual Studio 2019 (by installing the required Nuget Package / Extension).

## Share it!
I have personally not come across a clean implementation on a WebAPI, which is the reason that I started building this up. There are quite a lot of improvements and fixes along the way from the day I started out. Thanks to the community for the support and suggestions.
Please share this Repository within your developer community, if you think that this would a difference! Thanks.
